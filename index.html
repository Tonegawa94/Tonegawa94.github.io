          <h3>Playing Games</h3>
          <p>I have been gaming since I was a young child, and have always had an interest in video games. I don't have a specific genre and I tend to love any and all games and am willing to play anything
          from racing, to rpg(which are my favorite) and even fps.</p>

          <h3>Driving</h3>
          <p>One of my absolute favorite things to do is drive cars. Whether it be a road trip or just a trip down to the store. I have always enjoyed driving around and have had an interest in cars as well.</p>
